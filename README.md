## Personal Portfolio Website 

### Motivation
As a computer science student, to showcase some project, I created this dynamic portfolio website. This website looks the same as any other portfolio website but, it has a backend which makes it unique. The problem that I faced is, once a portfolio website is created, it is a hassle to keep it updated and edit the code every now and then. To solve that problem I implemented a backend to add, delete or edit the content like experience or project on portfolio website using a frontend UI, without editing a single line of code.

### Tech Stack and Approach
To make this project I used React in frontend, nodejs as a backend server and MongoDB as my database. React has wide variety of external libraries and the one I used is ThreeJS. Threejs enables 3D rendering on a webpage so initially I created a 3D Rendered background. Rendering 3D is very expensive for a webpage and takes some time to render, for which is had to create loading screen. Soon I moved away from 3D rendering and insted used video's and parallax effects as a background which are much less demanding and very appealing with less amount of work compared to 3D rendering.
UI for this website is ever evolving and is subjected to different experimentation every now and then.
